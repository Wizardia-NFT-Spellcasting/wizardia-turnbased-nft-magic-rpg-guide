## 🧠 What is Wizardia?

Wizardia is a 3v3 turn-based strategy RPG set in a mystical fantasy world. Players build teams of NFT wizards, each with unique skills, elemental affinities, and magical gear. Battles reward players with $WZRD tokens, which can be staked, used for upgrades, or traded on the Web3 marketplace.

All characters and equipment are NFTs, granting ownership, utility, and potential passive income.
